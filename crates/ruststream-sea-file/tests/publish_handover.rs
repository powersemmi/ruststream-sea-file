//! What the in-process stands do with the buffer the framework hands them on the publish path.
//!
//! Both stands declare `Take`, because a recorded delivery keeps its payload; the two real
//! publishers lend theirs, so there is nothing to hand over on those. Content equality cannot
//! tell a hand-over from a copy, so the payload is followed by the address it was written at, and
//! the map by what a publish carrying it allocates.
